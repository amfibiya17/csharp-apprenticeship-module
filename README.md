# C# Fundamentals

_Coaching this? Read the coach guidance
[here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/slug/blob/main/materials/universe/language_intros/challenges/csharp/README.ed.md)_

C# is a very popular language in the software world. It can be used to build a lot of different kind of programs, including desktop, mobile and web applications. If you've previously learned a language like Ruby or Javascript, C# is going to feel really different in a number of ways - but nothing that you cannot learn!

In this module, you'll first see how to write and execute basic C# programs, and also learn about some important things such as how to use types and how to write tests using NUnit. You'll then build a more complex program (a CLI game) using object-oriented C# features.

## Learning objectives

* Test-drive a simple C# program.
* Explain the main differences between C# and a language like Ruby.
* Apply a coherent process to learn a new language.

## Getting Started

1. [Your first C# program](./main/01_first_csharp_program.md) 
2. [Types and compilation](./main/02_compile_error.md)
3. [IDE setup](./main/03_ide.md)
4. [Testing with NUnit](./main/04_testing_with_nunit.md)

## Pairing challenge 

1. [Building a word-guessing game - Part I](./main/05_challenge_game.md)
2. [Building a word-guessing game - Part II](./main/06_challenge_word_chooser.md)
3. [Building a word-guessing game - Part III](./main/07_challenge_player_guesses.md)
4. [Building a word-guessing game - Part IV](./main/08_challenge_guessed_letters.md)
5. [Building a word-guessing game - Part V](./main/09_challenge_game_over.md)
